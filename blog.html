    <h2 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 50px"> Climbing Outdoors for the First Time <div class="blog-date">1 August '17</div></h2>
    
    <div class="blog">
        I started climbing after coming to the United States. I had played soccer for most of my life but the absence of a 
        footballing (Soccer) culture coupled with my dwindling ability and willingness to do high-intensity cardio forced me 
        to find a new sport. I had initially hoped to join the rowing club but missed the callouts. I then found climbing.
        <br>
        <br>
        It would be difficult for someone to find a more beginner-friendly sport. Each gym has routes or "problems" of varying difficulty 
        for beginner to veteran climbers and the community is incredibly supportive. No matter where you're climbing, you'll find 
        a couple of people giving you tips and encouragement whenever they see you struggling on a problem. I am nowhere near as 
        good at climbing as I was at Soccer, and I'm still learning. After my first day climbing, my arms were sore for the next 3 days.
        I was made aware of muscles in my arm I didn't know existed. I didn't know there was such a thing as finger strength until I saw people 
        doing pull-ups off of their pinkies. All in all, my first day had me hooked.
        <br>
        <br>        
        However, as any climber will tell you, you aren't actually a climber until you've done it outdoors. Soon after getting acquainted
        with climbing and learning the basic tips and tricks, it dawned on me that I was too heavy to climb effectively. I was having trouble
        climbing 5.7 routes. I spent most of my first semester losing 25 lbs. until I was confident I could hold myself up on the wall
        for longer periods and soon began climbing 5.9s and some 5.10s. In my spring semester of freshman year, I made it a goal to go 
        climbing outside sometime. This would be difficult since I didn't know how to drive and didn't have good friends who climbed. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I did eventually go climbing outdoors, at Horseshoe Canyon Ranch in Jasper, AR, over spring break with the Purdue Climbing Club 
        (that's me in the red flannel in the background). 
        Spring break was approaching and I had plans to go to Miami with friends from India who were in the USA for college as well. Those
        plans came to nothing because our schools didn't close at the same time, so their spring break was either one week before or after
        mine. This turned out to be for the best since the Climbing Club was planning an outdoor trip. I had doubts about going because I 
        didn't know anyone in the club and wasn't a very good climber, but I didn't want to be sitting in my dorm for a week with nothing to
        do. And so, with much apprehension, I clicked 'going' on the Facebook event. I made sure to ask the senior members of the club if
        my inexperience and inability to drive would make me unwelcome and a liability but I was told to not worry about it. There was no 
        turning back now, so I did some research and ordered the equipment I'd need. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        Even though it was "Spring" break, the temperature for the first 3 days was near-freezing, and only 
        slightly above it for the rest of the trip. The 3 seasons in my cheapo 3-season sleeping bag didn't include winter unfortunately and 
        I was lucky that the trip leader was carrying liners that kept me from freezing to death. Three out of the four pairs of socks 
        that I had brought got wet on my first day and I was sure that I was never going to regain feeling in my feet after being numb for 6 hours.
        I know it doesn't like it but the decision to go to rural Arkansas with 11 close-knit strangers to do a very specific activity while 
        being not very good at that specific activity lead to me having one the best experiences of my life. My fellow climbers were all so 
        supportive and as excited to show me the ropes as I was to learn. I got more comfortable being the new guy when I saw that even 
        though I was undoubtably the least-skilled person in the group, I was not the only person who was there to learn. Along with me 
        were a few others who were more experienced than I was but still not experts. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I was told about the expectations and etiquettes of outdoor climbing. I learned how to lead climb and how to clean routes. I learned that
        real rock is sharp. I learned that your fingers being numb from the cold can be a good and bad thing; good because you don't feel the pain 
        from the sharp rocks and bad because you can't trust your grip. I learned not to fall from overhangs. I showered exactly zero times that trip.
        Camping in that weather with bleeding fingers and bruised sides was miserable, but looking back, it was the most fun I'd had in a long time 
        and I learned so much.

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 50px"> Consistent Hashing <div class="blog-date">19 July '17</div></h2>
    
    <div class="blog">
        Consistent Hashing is a kind of hashing in which resizing requires only a fraction of the keys to be remapped as opposed to 
        traditional hash tables which often cause the remapping of all or nearly all of the keys. The idea was first introduced in 1997, 
        in an academic paper (<a href="https://www.akamai.com/es/es/multimedia/documents/technical-publication/consistent-hashing-and-random-trees-distributed-caching-protocols-for-relieving-hot-spots-on-the-world-wide-web-technical-publication.pdf" target="_blank">
        Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web</a> 
        by David Karger et al) at MIT for use in distributed caching. It has since then been used in many services like Amazon’s
        in-house DynamoDB database service.
        <br>
        <br>
        The usefulness of consistent hashing becomes apparent in the context of distributed systems. It elegantly solves some of the 
        problems that come with scale. A common way to achieve load balancing is to hash(key) % n where n is the number of servers. 
        This works well only till the point one needs to add or remove servers. When such addition/removal occurs, n changes and all 
        the keys need to be remapped. When working with very large databases distributed in thousands of servers, such remapping of 
        keys using traditional hashing can be disastrous if 10-15% of the servers shut down due to any reason. This problem is solved
        with consistent hashing.
        <br>
        <br>
        Consistent hashing maps keys to the same node, as far as possible. The consistent hashing algorithm involves hashing both the keys and 
        nodes to an interval which has key hashes. If any node is removed, then the keys contained in its interval are mapped to the adjacent 
        node and if any node is added, the keys contained in the newly defined interval are mapped to the new node.
        <br>
        <br>
        This can give rise to unequally sized intervals since the mapping of nodes is random. This problem is solved using virtual nodes which 
        correspond to the physical nodes. So, when a new node is added to the system, the virtual nodes ensure that the new node takes the 
        load from many other physical nodes rather than splitting the load of just the adjacent physical node.
        <br>
        <br>
        Consistent hashing ensures that:
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	All nodes receive roughly the same number of keys 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •	When a new node is added or removed, only a fraction of the keys have to be moved to a new location.
