    <h2> Soccer </h2>
    <p class="about-me">
        I've been playing Soccer for as long as I can remember. The sport has been a very important part of my life and
        is responsible in many ways in shaping the person I am today. I found some of my closest friends playing for my
        high school. Growing up in a country where high school education was extremely stressful and promoted
        rote-learning, it was very easy to burn out and lose motivation. Soccer was the thread that kept me hanging
        for 4 stressful years of high school.

    <h2> Rock Climbing </h2>
    <p class="about-me">
        <img src="./static/5.9.jpg" 
        alt="Climbing at Horsheshoe Canyon Ranch"
        style="height: 160px; width: 297px; max-width: 100%; margin: 30px 30px 60px 0px" align="left">
        I started climbing after coming to the United States. The absence of a footballing (Soccer) culture coupled 
        with my dwindling ability and willingness to do high-intensity cardio forced me to find a new sport. Climbing
        filled that gap for me. It would be difficult for someone to find a more beginner-friendly sport. Every gym
        has routes of varying difficulty for beginners to veteran climbers and the community is incredibly supportive.
        No matter where you're climbing, you'll find a couple of people giving you tips and encouragement whenever 
        they see you struggling on a problem.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am nowhere near as good at climbing as I was at Soccer, and still learning. I went climbing outdoors at Horseshoe
        Canyon Ranch in Jasper, AR over spring break with the Purdue Climbing Club. It was an incredible learning experience.
        I was told about the expectations and etiquettes of outdoor climbing. I learned lead climbing and 
        cleaning routes. It was near-freezing and the rocks were sharp. Camping in that weather with bleeding fingers and
        bruised sides was miserable, but looking back, it was the most fun I'd had in a long time and I learned so much.

    <h2> Guitar </h2>
    <p class="about-me">
        For most of high school, I primarily listened to classic rock music. As any fan of the genre will tell you, it is
        very guitar-centric. So it was natural for me to want to learn how to play the guitar.
